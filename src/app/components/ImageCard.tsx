            While being more connected than ever, we feel more disconnected than
            ever. People desire to belong and be part of something bigger than
            ourselves. We swear by creator-driven companies embracing
            communities being the future. This thesis drives the company culture
            at Blank Studio shaping the processes and systems of the companyâ€”a
            culture driven by freedom with a lot of responsibility.
